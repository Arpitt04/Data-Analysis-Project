# Data-Analysis-Project
This is a project I completed under the Google Data Analysis course. 
It's Business task was to find out the difference between the usage of bikes by Annual Members and Casual Riders. 
The entire raw data was not able to upload due to it's size. So, I uploaded a part of raw data, part of the cleaned data, Pivot Tables and the final Data analysis report.
